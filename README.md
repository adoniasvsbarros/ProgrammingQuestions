# ProgrammingQuestions
Series of questions from competitive programming, mainly from the Codility website (https://www.codility.com/) and the Codingame website (https://www.codingame.com/).

Inside the src, each package describes one covered topic with different questions inside that topic. For each package, you can find one class called [packagename]Test.java, in this class you can see the basic JUnit tests for every question within the package. For every solved puzzle, you may or may not find a link, since they come from different sources.

Please, note that the questions are intended to give a performative solution, and the primary objective is the logic concepts behind them, software engineering concepts are not being applied in this case, for instance, you will find many variables with one, two, or three letters, going against the readability principle.
